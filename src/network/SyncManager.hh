    /// \brief Used to manage syncronization between simulation primary and
    /// simulation secondaries.
    ///
    /// Utilizes the concept of "performers" introduced in the level manager.
    /// Each performer has an affinity, which is the mapping between the
    /// performer and the distributed simulation secondary. The distributed
    /// simulation primary does not have any performers of itself, but
    /// purely manages the distribution of performers to the secondaries.
    ///
    /// ## Primary - Secondary communication
    ///
    /// * The primary notifies secondaries of affinity changes using each
    /// secondary's `/<namespace>/affinity` service.
    ///
    /// * Each secondary sends the state update of its performers via the
    /// /state_update topic.
    ///
    /// ## Components
    ///
    /// The SyncManager will also attach components to the performer entity to
    /// manage the distribution:
    /// * PerformerAffinity: notes the secondary that each performer is
    /// associated with.
    /// * PerformerActive: marks whether the performer is active on this
    /// secondary - so it isn't really transferable simulation state.
